# NW Dashboard Project

NW Dashboard is a React-based dashboard application designed to provide an overview of various statistics and data insights for teams. The application is built with reusable components, styled using Tailwind CSS, and features a seamless UI powered by ShadCN UI. Data validation is handled by Zod, while Redux is used for state management. The project is also built with TypeScript for type-safe development.
